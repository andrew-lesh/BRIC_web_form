    <p2>On December 1, 2021, the Stanford Student Space Initiative's Biopolymer Research for In-situ Capabilities (BRIC) 
        payload will fly to the International Space Station, where it will test the formation of biopolymer-bound soil 
        composite, a sustainable concrete-like building material, in microgravity.  This carbon-neutral material, made 
        from soil and a small amount of protein binder and water, may one day be used to make landing pads, habitats, and 
        cities on Earth, the Moon, Mars, and other planets.</p>
